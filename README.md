# Sentiment Text analysis 
This project is all about demonstration on Sentiment Text analysis using Tensorflow 

## What is Sentiment analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. Itâ€™s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.

Sentiment analysis in NLP (Natural Language Processing) is about deciphering such sentiment from text. Is it positive, negative, both, or neither? If there is sentiment, which objects in the text the sentiment is referring to and the actual sentiment phrase such as poor, blurry, inexpensive. This is also called aspect-based analysis. But for our project, we considered two sentiments alone. 

## Requirements needed:
Libraries Used:

    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - tensorflow
    - Keras
    - Scikit-learn
    - tensorflow_text
    - tensorflow_hub

    Generally, a review dataset (it can be feedback, movie reviews) is preferred for this project.
